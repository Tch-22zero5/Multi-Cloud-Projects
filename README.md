# Multi-cloud refers to the practice of using multiple cloud computing services from different providers like Amazon web services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Oracle Cloud Infrastucture (OCI) to meet an organization's computing needs. It involves distributing workloads, applications, data, and other resources across multiple cloud environments, which can include public clouds, private clouds, and hybrid clouds. In a multi-cloud setup, an organization can leverage the services and features offered by different cloud providers to take advantage of their strengths, such as cost-effectiveness, scalability, geographical reach, specialized services, or compliance requirements. By using multiple cloud providers, organizations can avoid vendor lock-in, reduce the risk of service disruptions, and optimize their cloud strategy based on specific requirements.
